# Motive:
A project that aims to provide a better way of distributing movies using the blockchain, it aims to minimise piracy and provide a platform to finance and sell movies for everyone. It can vastly help small producers and indie movie production.

The movies are first steganograhpically watermarked and then hashed, these respective hash point to a specific movie and that movie is put up for sale on the Web3 enabled portal. This all works on a Smart Contract running on EVM via Truffle
